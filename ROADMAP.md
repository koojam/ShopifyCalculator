## Project Context

### Project Overview
Building a comprehensive Shopify Cost Calculator using React + Vite with Chakra UI for styling. The calculator helps potential Shopify entrepreneurs estimate their startup costs and profitability.

### Technical Stack
- Frontend: React with Vite
- UI Framework: Chakra UI
- State Management: React useState (local state)
- Styling: Chakra UI components

### Key Files
- `src/main.jsx`: Entry point, contains ChakraProvider setup
- `src/App.jsx`: Main app component
- `src/components/Calculator.jsx`: Main calculator component
- `vite.config.js`: Vite configuration

### Current Implementation
- Calculator displays in a white container with a gradient header
- Includes Shopify plan selection (Basic, Shopify, Advanced)
- Toggle between monthly and yearly billing (25% discount for yearly)
- Shows plan costs and transaction fees
- Uses Shopify's current CAD pricing (as of 2024)

### Pricing Structure (CAD)
Monthly Plans:
- Basic: $51/month
- Shopify: $132/month
- Advanced: $517/month

Yearly Plans (25% discount):
- Basic: $38/month
- Shopify: $99/month
- Advanced: $389/month

Transaction Fees:
- Basic: 2.8% + 30Â¢ CAD online
- Shopify: 2.6% + 30Â¢ CAD online
- Advanced: 2.4% + 30Â¢ CAD online

### Design References
- Following Shopify's design system
- Using Shopify's color scheme (#f3fcf0 for highlights, #008060 for primary actions)
- Matching Shopify's typography and spacing

### Next Steps
Currently in Phase 2: Adding enhanced cost inputs including product information and additional costs sections. 

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Main development branch
- Feature branches: `feature/phase-{number}-{feature-name}`
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/{issue-description}`

### Git Workflow Per Phase
1. Before starting new phase:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/phase-{number}-{feature-name}
   ```

2. During development:
   ```bash
   # Commit frequently with meaningful messages
   git add .
   git commit -m "phase-{number}: descriptive message"
   ```

3. After completing a feature:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/phase-{number}-{feature-name}
   # Create Pull Request on GitHub
   ```

4. After phase completion:
   - Merge feature branch into main
   - Tag version: `git tag v{phase-number}.0.0`
   - Push tags: `git push origin --tags`

### Commit Message Format
```
phase-{number}: Brief description

- Detailed bullet points of changes
- Additional context if needed
```

### Current Repository
- GitHub: https://github.com/koojam/ShopifyCalculator.git
- Main Branch: Protected, requires pull request
- Development Branch: Direct commits allowed 

### Deployment
- Platform: Vercel
- Production URL: https://shopify-calculator-nu.vercel.app/
- Auto-deployment: Enabled from main branch
- Build Command: `npm run build`
- Output Directory: `dist`

## Current Status
### Phase 2 Completed âœ…
- Enhanced cost inputs with decimal support
- Additional costs section implemented
- Industry averages and tooltips added
- Improved calculations and revenue handling
- Currency formatting with thousand separators
- Successfully deployed to Vercel

### Next Up: Phase 3
Focus on Advanced Calculations & Visualization:
- Cost breakdown visualizations
- Monthly overhead calculations
- Transaction fees calculator improvements
- Data visualization with Chart.js

## Known Issues to Address:
- Redundant revenue input (needs consolidation)
- Transaction fees calculation needs to be updated
- Consider adding thousand separators for large numbers
